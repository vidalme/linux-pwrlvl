##User and Group Management Exercise: New Employee Onboarding
<h3>Scenario:</h3>

You are a mid-level system administrator at a small software company. A new employee, John Smith, is starting in the Marketing department tomorrow. Your manager has provided you with the following information about John:<br>

Name: John Smith<br>
Department: Marketing<br>
Job Title: Marketing Associate<br>
Required Access: John needs access to the company fileserver to download marketing materials, the internal bug tracking system to report any issues encountered, and the corporate email system.<br><br>
<h3>Your Task:</h3>

<li>Create User Account: Create a user account for John Smith on the company's Linux server using the appropriate command-line tools.</li>
<li>Set Password: Set a temporary password for John that adheres to your company's password policy (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).</li>
<li>Assign Groups: Add John to the appropriate user groups based on his department and required access needs.</li>
<ul>
<li>Marketing group (for file server access)</li>
<li>Bug tracking group (for access to the bug tracking system)</li>
Mail group (for access to the email system)
Grant Permissions: Grant John the necessary permissions on the marketing materials directory on the file server to allow him to download files.
Provide Instructions: Send an email to John with instructions on how to log in to the system for the first time, including his temporary password and any additional information needed (e.g., server hostname, VPN access details).
Additional Considerations:

Use real-world examples of commands for user creation, group assignment, and permission granting specific to your chosen Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).
Make sure to follow your company's security policies and best practices for user and group management.
Document your actions and decisions during the exercise for future reference.
This exercise simulates a real-life task commonly performed by mid-level system administrators and allows you to practice essential user and group management skills.
